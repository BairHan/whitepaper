# 4. Marketing plan



## Marketing within the Crypto space

* Post-launch, we aim to have the first PROC protocol live and ready for customers to use by February 2024.
* PROC will be listed on P2Pb2B, MEX, Bitmart, Coingecko, Coinmarketcap and other token sites.
* Reddit campaign encouraging early adoption post-launch.
* PROC Lotteries for senders and holders: we will hold random lotteries based on hitting targets of X PROC cards sent. Because both senders and receivers can win these PROC tokens (which will be airdropped) we will incentivize early adoption of the protocol
* Community cultivation: PROC has a team of experienced admins who will develop an active and highly-engaged userbase in our Telegram chat and other communities.
* Video marketing: simple short videos that explain how to use PROC will be shared across all our major channels.
* Phase 1 Primary Marketing Channels: Telegram, Twitter, Discord.

## Mainstream Marketing

* As soon as the main users who are not users of our network begin to receive PROC, mass implementation will follow.
* Influencer marketing: Influencers in the crypto/tech space will receive PROC and make reaction/”unboxing” style videos
* Experienced Social Media Manager full-time running Twitter, Instagram, TikTok campaigns and more.
* Crypto Youtuber and Podcast partnerships&#x20;
* Community management Phase 2: Our dedicated PROC Team will  run events, organize weekly competitions, and give the community a chance to play an active role in PROC’s development.&#x20;
* In this phase, we aim to see at least 10,000 conversions (PROC vouchers sent) within the first month of launch.
* Primary channels: Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, TikTok, Email, Google Ads, and more.
