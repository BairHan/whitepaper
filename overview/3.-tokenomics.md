## Features

* The PROC coin is issued on its own blockchain
* PROC tokens will also be issued in other networks: BSC, Polygon and Solana.
* The token charges 3% a transaction fee on all transactions, this tax can be changed by the token owner to between 1-5%.
* The transaction fees will initially be divided into:
  * Redistribution fee 2%
  * Marketing and Development fee 1%
  * Liquidity Provider pool fee 0%
  * Partner Rewards pool fee 0%
* A 5% initial token burn will slowly accumulate part of the redistribution fee, causing a slow token burn to occur.
