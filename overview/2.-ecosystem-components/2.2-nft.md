# 2.2 NFT

{% hint style="success" %}
For each NFT, information about the object and methods for managing it is posted.
{% endhint %}

All NFT objects (technologies, goods, services) are checked for uniqueness, after which they are placed on the trading platform. The information of the object with the description and price is loaded. The owner receives the right to manage, i.e. can exchange, sell his NFT at any time.&#x20;

All NFT objects are issued and transferred under a single ERC-721 contract and transferred to the ecosystem internally and to third-party DeFi services. NFT is, accordingly, the key to managing real estate and generating income from this object in the main ecosystem token.

We also have functionality for co-management. In cases of such retention issues, there are multiple NFTs, each containing an ownership interest in the object. Management decisions in this case are transmitted through the DAO to all owners.
