PROC EcoWorld is a game in which users will be able to build a virtual biogas complex, manage it and process organic waste into biofertilizers with sale on their own marketplace. Users will be able to turn waste into income, learn how to earn and easily exchange for real products.

PROC Light is a browser game for the PROC community that will guide users through the entire ecosystem in a fun way to get more PROC. Moreover, we are considering a full-fledged mobile version, which can become a lite version of PROC World in the form of a go-to-market funnel. PROC Portal (PROC Map) is a web portal for the gaming community where you can view the PROC world map, create your own guild or find a suitable one, manage complexes, participate in DAO decision making, participate in events and much more.
